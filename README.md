## Overview

This project provides Rust bindings for the [Apache Arrow Gandiva](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/gandiva.html#), enabling Rust-based OLAP systems to leverage code generation (codegen) techniques for improved performance.

## Features

- Easy integration with Rust-based data processing systems.
- Access to Gandiva's codegen capabilities for optimizing query execution.
- Support for a wide range of data transformation and filtering operations.

## Attention

This project is currently in the performance comparison testing phase between Arrow-rs and Gandiva, and welcome everyone to participate and discuss.
